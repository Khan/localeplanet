As of 16 May 2013, localeplanet supports date formatting and number
formatting, but not time formatting.  (Though it does have
translations for AM and PM.)  This should be enough for our purposes,
which include translating highcharts, the various date-pickers we
have, our own commafy method, etc.

We like localeplanet because the data files are very short, and
they're separated out per-language, just like we like.

The short download.sh script downloads the latest data from
localeplanet, making sure to get all the languages that babel
supports.

After downloading icu.en.js is modified in the following way:

-       window.icu = window.icu || new Object();
-       var icu = window.icu;
+    var icu;
+
+    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
+        icu = window.icu = window.icu || {};
+    } else if (typeof module !== "undefined") {
+        icu = module.exports = {};
+    }

This makes it so that icu becomes available when running our JS inside Node.

After running download.sh, you also need to run add_module_exports.py. See
add_module_exports.py for instructions.
